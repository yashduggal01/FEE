         <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[16] Versions were later released for Linux, macOS, iOS, and also for Android, where it is the default browser.[17] The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.</p>

      <h1><mark><u>Mozilla</u></mark></h1>
      <p> Mozilla is a free software community founded in 1998 by members of Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, publishes and supports Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open standards, with only minor exceptions.[1] The community is supported institutionally by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.[2]

        Mozilla's current products include the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird e-mail client (now through a subsidiary), the Bugzilla bug tracking system, the Gecko layout engine, and the Pocket "read-it-later-online" service.[3]</p>

         <h1><mark><u>Microsoft edge</u></mark></h1>
         <p> Microsoft Edge (or simply Edge) is a proprietary cross-platform web browser created by Microsoft. Released in 2015 as part of Windows 10 and Xbox One, it was initially built with Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine, EdgeHTML, and their Chakra JavaScript engine.[8] Later on, it was ported to Android and iOS[9][10] as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source project. In late 2018, Microsoft announced it would completely rebuild Edge as a Chromium-based[11][12] browser with Blink and V8 engines, which allowed the browser to be ported to macOS. The new Edge was publicly released in January 2020,[13][14] and on Xbox platforms in 2021.[15][16] Microsoft has since terminated security support for the original browser (now referred to as Microsoft Edge Legacy).[17] Edge is also available on older Windows versions until early 2023,[18][19] as well as Linux.[20][21]</p>
