Wells is a clever, short novella that describes the exploits of the “Invisible Man.” The man, whose real name is Griffin, turns up at an inn at the beginning of the book. A deep mystery surrounds his identity and intentions. But, it soon becomes clear that through his experimentations, he’s managed to turn himself invisible and is planning a “Reign of Terror” across the country. The small town residents recognize the danger he poses and do what they can to apprehend him.
